# 🎮 Tetris in Python

Welcome to **Tetris.py.com**, a classic Tetris remake built from scratch using **Python** and **Pygame**. This is a fun side project I created to explore game development, understand real-time rendering, and deepen my understanding of how 2D games work under the hood.

## 🧩 Features

- ✅ 7 Classic Tetromino shapes (I, O, T, S, Z, J, L)
- 🎨 Each piece has a unique color
- 🔄 Piece rotation
- ⏬ Soft drop & ⏱ Hard drop
- ❌ Collision detection
- 💥 Line clearing
- ☠️ Game over detection

## 🕹️ Controls

| Key         | Action                  |
|-------------|--------------------------|
| `←` / `→`    | Move piece left / right |
| `↑`         | Rotate piece             |
| `↓`         | Soft drop                |
| `Spacebar`  | Hard drop (instant fall) |

## 💡 Developer Notes

This project was a great exercise in:

* Managing 2D grids
* Real-time input handling
* Game state management
* Basic graphics rendering

> One of the trickiest parts was handling collision detection while allowing rotation near edges and other blocks. I also implemented a simple hard drop mechanic for fast-paced gameplay.

## 🔧 Roadmap / Ideas

* 🎵 Add sound effects and background music
* 🧮 Implement score tracking
* 🔄 Add pause/resume functionality
* 🌐 Create a menu or splash screen
* 🌟 Add animations and visual polish
